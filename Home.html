  My name is Ayanna Sabb, When I was younger I had trouble with finding out what was my purpose on being on Earth, <br>
  until one day I saw this girl struggling with bullying and trying to find ways to avoid the situation.  I figured why not become her friend.From then we started sitting together at lunch, <br>
  hanging out after school and even going to get matching outfits. My purpose was to then help encourage people and help them figure out what's their favorite thing to do. From that moment on  I told myself that <br>
  I wanted to not only  help build myself, but build other people. However, I discovered later  in my early teens, all it took was a little encouragement and some positive help. Now I am building my own blog to let people share their stories and for me to give some helpful feedback. </p>
